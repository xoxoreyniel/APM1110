I. Geometric Distribution. Provide an R code for the geometric distribution. The geometric distribution is a probability distribution that models the number of trials required to achieve the first success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials, where each trial has a constant probability of success.

1. Set the probability of success:  p <- 0.2

2. Generate 1000 random variables from the geometric distribution.

3. Calculate some basic statistics:

    mean_x <- mean(x)

    var_x <- var(x)

    sd_x <- sd(x)

4. Print the results in item 3 with the following output (string): 

    Number of trials required to achieve first success:

    Mean (in 2 decimal places):

    Variance (in 2 decimal places):

    Standard deviation ( in 2 decimal places):

5. Plot the histogram of the results.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
p <- 0.2
x <- rgeom(1000, p) + 1

cat("Number of trials required to achieve first success:\n")
cat(sprintf("Mean: %.2f\nVariance: %.2f\nStandard Deviation: %.2f\n", mean(x), var(x), sd(x)))

hist(x, main="Geometric Distribution", col="lightblue", breaks=30, xlab="Trials")
```

II. Hypergeometric Distribution. Consider a plant manufacturing IC chips of which 10% are expected to be defective. The chips are packed in boxes for export. Before transportation, a sample is drawn from each box. Estimate the probability that the sample contains more than 10% defectives, when:

1. A sample of 10 is selected from a box of 40;
2. A sample of 10 is selected from a box of 5000.

```{r}
p_hyper1 <- 1 - phyper(1, 4, 36, 10)  # 10% of 40 is 4 defectives
p_hyper2 <- 1 - phyper(1, 500, 4500, 10)  # 10% of 5000 is 500 defectives

cat("\nHypergeometric Distribution:\n")
cat(sprintf("P(more than 10%% defectives) - Box of 40: %.5f\n", p_hyper1))
cat(sprintf("P(more than 10%% defectives) - Box of 5000: %.5f\n", p_hyper2))
```
