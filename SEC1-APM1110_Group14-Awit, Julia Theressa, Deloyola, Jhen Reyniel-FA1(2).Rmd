## Exercise
For the class of 50 students of computing detailed in Exercise 1.1, use R to:

1. Form the stem-and-leaf display for each gender, and discuss the advantages of this representation compared to the traditional histogram.
2. Construct a box-plot for each gender and discuss the findings.

## Solution

### (a) Stem-and-Leaf Display
```{r}
# Load the dataset (replace 'path/to/your/dataset.csv' with the actual file path)
data <- read.csv("path/to/your/dataset.csv")

# Stem-and-Leaf Display for Male
cat("Stem-and-Leaf for Male:\n")
stem(data$arch1[data$gender == "Male"])

# Stem-and-Leaf Display for Female
cat("\nStem-and-Leaf for Female:\n")
stem(data$arch1[data$gender == "Female"])

# Advantages of Stem-and-Leaf Display:
# - Retains raw data values while giving an overview of distribution.
# - Easier to identify individual values compared to histograms.
# - Useful for smaller datasets.
```

### (b) Box Plot for Each Gender
```{r}
# Box plot of 'arch1' scores by gender
boxplot(arch1 ~ gender, data = data,
        main = "Box Plot of Scores by Gender",
        xlab = "Gender",
        ylab = "Scores",
        col = c("lightblue", "pink"))

# Findings:
# - The box plot reveals the median, range, and any outliers for each gender.
# - Compare distributions to observe differences in spread, central tendency, and variability.
